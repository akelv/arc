Arc

Aim at helping software developer to design and deliver software product with clear architecture and clean working code. By simplifying architecture design and management complexity of software systems that comprises tens to hundreds of microservices. 

Arc is a simple utility to author, view, inspect and update software architecture design. Utilizing concept promoted by C4Context. Arc promote architecture as code and full integration to CiCd workflows such that archictecture information is accumulated and kept up to date as the system complexity grows, easily and free of any additional manual effort. 

Expected outcome is the implementation and design information reflect each other accurately such that the design information become useful to boost time to market and maintainability of working software systems.
